TL/DR: This Repository contains some, if not all, solutions to programming tasks I had and still have to solve in college. I take no responsibility for any errors or misspellings or fail grades you might recieve for using my solutions.

### About me
Hi! I'm Simon, a 20 year old student of University Potsdam, who wants to become a teacher one day. My focus is set on mathmatics and computer scince and while I love computer scince, mathmatics is my cryptonite. So I will only be sharing tasks I realy know how to solve.

### Modules
As a student of either highschool or college, you may be familiar with the term module. Basically modules are subjects and every branch will be a module.

- Basics of Programing (Grundlagen der Programmierung)
- Theory of Computer Science 1 (Maschinenmodelle)
- Algorithms and Data Structures (Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen)
- Practical Programing (Praxis der Programmierung)
